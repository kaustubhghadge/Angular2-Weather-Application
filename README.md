# Angular2-Weather-Application

This is a Weather Application which provides temperature and current weather description. This application is created using Angular2 and uses OpenWeatherMap API. 

This project is a work in progress. The purpose of this project is to understand the fundamentals of Angular 2.

Setup: 

Step 1. Clone this repository and in that location open up the terminal window. 

Step 2. Type: npm install (for installing dependencies)

Step 3. Type: npm start   (for loading up the application in default web browser)

At present, the application takes in only a City name. So the user must enter any valid City name which will display its temperature and weather description.
